# Shootin' Hoops VR
This project was developed for CIS 507 Seminar on CIS Careers and Internships
## Project Overview
Built with Unity 5.5

This project is intended to work with the HTC Vive and uses the SteamVR plugin and the VRTK library

Shootin' Hoops VR is a Virtual Reality basketball game. The end goal of the development of this game is to allow players to play multiple game modes; shoot around, 3 point shootout, and multiplayer PIG or HORSE.  
## Current State
The following features are implemented:
1. Modeled and textured basketball floor, hoops, and ball
2. Shooting the ball. To pick up the ball click the trigger, to let go click the trigger again.
3. Movement. Movement uses the VRTK implementation of "Move in place" movement. To move click the trackpad and pump your arms, as if you are running in place
4. Detecting made shots. Currently the number of made shots since starting is displayed on a rudimentary scoreboard.
## Outlook
This project is no longer in active development and I do not intend to come back to it. I don't believe VR game based primarily on throwing(shooting) objects works well. It quickly becomes more frustrating than fun.
